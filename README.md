1            OverviewFor   this   coursework,   you   will   have   to   implement   a   classifier.   You   will   use   this   classifier   in   some   code   that   has   to   make   a   decision.      The   code   will   be   controlling    Pacman,   in   the   classic   game,   and   the   decision   will   be   about   how   Pacman   chooses   to   move.    Your   classifier    probably   won’t   help   Pacman   to   make   particularly   good   decisions   (I   will   be   surprised   if   it   helps   Pacman   win   games,   my   version   certainly   didn’t),   but   that   is   not   the   point.   The   point   is   to   write   a   classifier   and   use   it.
No   previous   experience   with   Pacman   (either   in   general,   or   with   the   specific   UC   Berkeley   AI   imple-   mentation   that   we   will   use)   is   required.
This   coursework   is   worth   10%   of the   marks   for   the   module.
Note:    Failure   to   follow   submission   instructions   will   result   in   a   deduction   of   10%   of   the   marks   you   earn   for   this   coursework.
2            Getting   started
2.1          Start   with   PacmanThe   Pacman code that we will   be   using for the   coursework   was   developed   at   UC   Berkeley   for   their   AI   course.   The   folk   who   developed   this   code   then   kindly   made   it   available   to   everyone.   The   homepage   for   the   Berkeley   AI   Pacman   projects   is   here:
http://ai.berkeley.edu/Note   that   we   will   not   be   doing   any   of their   projects.    Note   also   that   the   code   only   supports   Python   3,   so   that   is   what   we   will   use.1   You   should:
(a)      Download:
pacman-cw1.zip
from   KEATS.
(b)    Save   that   file   to   your   account   at   KCL   (or   to   your   own   computer).
(c)      Unzip   the   archive.
This   will   create   a   folder   pacman





Figure   1:   Pacman
(d)    From   the   command    line    (you   will   need   to   use   the   command   line   in   order   to   use   the   various   options),   switch   to   the   folder   pacman.
(e)      Now   type:
python3      pacman.py
This   will   open   up   a   window   that   looks   like   that   in   Figure   1
(f)    The   default   mode   is   for   keyboard   control,   so   you   should   be   able   to   play   this   game   out   using   the   arrow   keys.Playing   Pacman   is   not   the   object   here   —   don’t   worry   if   there   is   an   issue   with   controlling   Pacman   using   the   keys,   that   can   happen   on   some   platforms   —   but   you   will   need   to   run   this   code   to   do   the   coursework.   So,   if   the   code   causes   an   error,   get   help.
When   you   are   tired   of   running   Pacman,   move   on   to   the   next   section.
2.2            Code   to   control   Pacman
Now   we   work   towards   controlling   Pacman   by   writing   code.      The   file   sampleAgents   .py   contains   several   simple   pieces   of   code   for   controlling   Pacman.   You   can   see   one   of   these   run   by   executing:
python3    pacman.py    --pacman    RandomAgent
This   is   not   a   good   player   (it   is just   picking   from   the   available   actions   at   random),   but   it   shows   you   a   couple   of things.
First,   you   execute   an   agent   that   you   write   by   using   the   --pacman   option,   followed   by   the   name   of   a   Python   class.   The   Pacman   code   looks   for   this   class   in   files   called:


Agents   .py


and,   when   it   finds   the   class,   will   compile   the   relevant   class.       If   the   class   isn’t   in   an   appropriately   named   file,   you   will   get   the   error:
Traceback    (most      recent    call      last):
File    "pacman.py",    line    679,    in      
args      =    readCommand(    sys   .argv[1:]    )    #    Get      game      components      based      on      input
File    "pacman.py",    line    541,    in    readCommand
pacmanType    =    loadAgent(options.pacman,      noKeyboard)
File    "pacman.py",    line      608,      in      loadAgentraise      Exception(‘The      agent    ’    +    pacman      +    ‘    is    not    specified    in    any    *Agents   .py   .   ’)Now   open   your   favourite   editor   and   look   at   sampleAgents   .py.      If   you   look   at   RandomAgent   you   will   see   that   all   it   does   is   to   define   a   function   getAction().   This   function   is   the   only   thing   that   is   required   to   control   Pacman.       The   function   is   called   by   the   game   every   time   that   it   needs   to   know   what   Pacman   does —   at   every    “tick”   of the game   clock —   and what   it   needs to   return   is   an   action.   That   means   returning   expressions that the   rest   of the   code   can   interpret to   tell   Pacman   what   to   do.
In   the   basic   Pacman   game,   getAction()   returns   commands   like:   Directions   .STOP
which   tells   Pacman   to   not   move,   or:   Directions   .WEST
which   tells   Pacman   to   move   towards   the   left   side   of   its   grid   (North   is   up   the   grid).
However, for your coursework, you   have to   pass this   direction   to   the   function   api.makeMove()   first,   just   as   the   classes   in   sampleAgents   .py   do.
sampleAgents   .py   contains   a   second   agent,   RandomishAgent.    Try    running   it.    RandomishAgent   picks   a   random   action   and   then   keeps   doing   that   as   long   as   it   can.
2.3            Towards   a   classifierFor   this   coursework   you’ll   work   from   some   skeleton   code   that   is   in   the   folder   pacman-cw1.   The   file   to   look   for   is   classifier.py   which   is   used   in   classifierAgents   .py.    You   will   ONLY    need   to   modify   classifier.py   and   no   other   file.   Two   things   to   note   about   this:
(a)      The   skeleton   in   classifier.py   defines   a   class   Classifier,   and   classifierAgents   .py   defines   a   class   ClassifierAgent.   When   we   mark   your   coursework,   we   will   do   so   by   running   the   ClassifierAgent   class.    If this   doesn’t   exist   (or,   similarly,   if   class   Classifier   doesn’t   exist,   because   you   decided   to   rename   things),   we   will   mark   your   code   as   if   it   doesn’t   work.   So   make   life   easy   for   yourself,   and   use   the   classes   and   functions   provided   as   the   basis   for   your   code.      Again,   you   will   ONLY   need   to   modify   /   use   the   skeleton   in   classifier.py   and   no   other file.    We   cannot   accept   code   after the   deadline   has   passed   even   iferrors   are   of accidental   nature.


(b)    The   ClassifierAgent   class   provides   some   simple   data   handling.      It   reads   data   from   a   file   called   good-moves   .txt   and   turns   it   into   arrays   target   and   data   which   are   similar   to   the ones   you   have   used   with   scikit-learn.   When   we   test   your   code,   it   will   have   to   be   able   to   read   data   in   the   same   format   as   good-moves.txt,   from   a   file   called   good-moves   .txt.    If   it doesn’t,   we   will   mark   your   code   as   not   working.      So   make   life   easy   for   yourself   and   stick   to   the   (admittedly,   but   intentionally,   limited)   data   format   that   we   have   provided.
To   run   the   code   in   classifierAgents   .py, you   use:
python3      pacman.py      --pacman      ClassifierAgent
Note   the   difference   in   capitalisation   between   file   name   and   class   name.
Now   open   your   editor   and   take   a   look   at   the   code   for   ClassifierAgent.   There   are   six   functions   in   it:
(a)                  init               ()
The   constructor.      Run   when   an   instance   of   the   class   is   created.      Because   the   game   doesn’t   exist   at   this   point,   it   is   of   limited   use.
(b)      loadData()
This   is   a   simple   utility.   The   data   in   good-moves   .txt   is   stored   as   a   string.   We   need   it   as   an   array   of   integers.   This   does   the   conversion.
(c)   registerInitialState()This   function   gets   run   once   the   game   has   started   up.    Unlike               init()               ,   because the   game   has started, there   is game state   information available.    Thus   it   is   possible for   Pacman   to    “look”   at   the   world   around   it.
Right now this is the only function that is doing any real work.    It opens the file good-moves   .txt,   and extracts the data from   it, where data   is   parsed   into the arrays   data   and target.    These ar-         rays are accessible from any function.    (They are data members of the class ClassifierAgent.)
(d)      final()
This   function   is   run   at   the   end   of   a   game,   when   Pacman   has   either   won   or   lost.   (e)    convertNumberToMove()
Another   simple   utility.    The   data    in   good-moves   .txt   encodes    moves   that   Pacman   made   in   the   past   using   integers.   What   you   need   to   do   is   to   produce   moves   of the   form.	
Directions   .NORTH
since   that   is   the   format   which   the   game   engine   requires.    This   function   converts   from   one   to   the   other   in   a   way   that   respects   the   original   conversion   from   moves   to   integers.
(f)   getAction()This   function   is   called   by   the   game   engine   every   time   step.      What   it   returns   controls   what   Pacman   does.    Right   now   it   just   returns   Directions.EAST   or   a   random   move   (see   predict()   in   classifier.py).   (The   function   also   does   some   other   stuff,   but we will   get to that   later).
3          What   you   have   to   do    (and   what   you   aren’t   allowed   to   do)
3.1          Write   some   codeYour   task   in   this   coursework   is   to   write   a   classifier   using   classifier.py   which   uses   the   data   in   good-moves   .txt   to   control   Pacman.    By    “control   Pacman”   we   mean    “select   an   action   and   return   it   in   the   function   getAction   (the   code   is   already   set   up   for you   this way).    However,   because   this   is   a   module   on   machine   learning,   not   a   module   on   game   programming,   we   are   quite   prescriptive   about   how   you   go   about   doing   this:
(a)   Your   code   is   only   allowed   limited   access   to   information   about   the   state   of   the   game.    What   you   are   allowed   to   access   is   the   information   provided   by:
api.getFeatureVector(state)
This   returns   a   feature   vector   in   the   form   of   an   array   of   1s   and   0s   like   this:
[1,      0,      1,      0,      0,      1,      0,      1,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0,      0]This   records details of whether there are walls, food, and   ghosts   in   the   squares   around   Pacman.   You   don’t    need   to    know    what    each    number    means    (though    if    you    want   to    know,    look    in   api.py).    What   you   do    need   to   know   is   that   if   your   code   uses   any   other   information   about   the   game   to   decide   what   to   do,   you   won’t   get   any   marks   for   the   coursework.
(b)   Your code should   use a classifier to   make   a   decision,   based   on   the   information   in   features,   to   decide   what   to   do.   Thus   the   classifier   should   be   trained   using   the   information   in   self   .data   代 写6CCS3ML1 (Machine Learning) Coursework 1Python
代做程序编程语言and   self   .target,   and   should   predict   an   action   when   passed   the   data   in   features   (again,   this   is   already   set   up).
(c)    You   are   allowed   to   use   a   classifier   from   an   external   library   such   as   scikit-learn.      However,   if   you   use   a   classifier   from   an   external   library,   you   will   not   get   as   many   marks   as   if   you   write   a   classifier   yourself.    (For   details   on   exactly   how   we   will   mark   your   code,   see   the   marksheet   on   KEATS.   Also   ensure   you   read   the   coursework’s   FAQs   on   KEATS.)
(d)    If   you   do   code   your   own   classifier,    it   does   not   have   to   be   complicated.    It   could    be   as   simple   as   a   1-nearest   neighbour   classifier.      However,   the   more   sophisticated   the   classifier,   the   more   marks   you   will   get.    (Again,   for   details   you   should   see   the   marksheet   and   FAQs   on   KEATS.)
(e)    To get full   marks, your   code   has to   run   until   either   Pacman   wins   a   game,   or   until   Pacman   gets   eaten   by   a   ghost   (and   loses   a   game).    In   other   words,   your   code   should   not   crash   or   otherwise   fail   while   we   are   running   it.      Losing   a   game   is   not   failing.      In   fact,   from   the   point   of   view   of   marking,   we   don’t   care   if your   Pacman   wins,   loses,   gets   a   high   score   or   a   low   score.    We   only   care   that   your   code   successfully   uses   a   classifier   to   decide   what   to   do.
3.2          Things   to   know
If   you   look   in   good-moves   .txt,   you   will   see   that   each   line   contains   a   feature   vector   like   the   one   above,   plus   a   final   digit.    (There   are   no   brackets   or   commas,   that   is   because   good-moves   .txt   holds
3   Ok,    that    is    not    quite    right.          The    code    in    getAction      in      the      skeleton      classifierAgent    uses      legal    =   api.legalActions(state)   to   get   a   set   of the   legal   moves   at   every   step.    That   is   technically   information   about   the   game   state,   and   it   is   both   allowed,   and   sensible,   since   if you   return   an   illegal   action   to   the   game   engine,   the   game   crashes.   The   code   is   already   set   up   to   use   this.   Using   any   other   information   is,   however,   forbidden.   strings   not   arrays.)   The   first   digits   are   indeed   a   feature   vector,   and   the   last   digit   encodes   an   action.   When   the   data   is   read   in   by   registerInitialState,   the   feature vector   part   is   loaded   into   data,   and   the   “action”   is   loaded   into   target   such   that   the   ith   elements   of   data   and   target   go   together.   The   data   was   collected   from   code   that   played   Pacman.    (Indeed,   from   some   code   that   won   games   of   Pacman.)   At   each   step,   the   feature   vector   and   move   were   stored   in   good-moves   .txt.   And   that   is   exactly   why   you   can   create   a   classifier   from   it.    If you   train   a   classifier   on   the   good-moves   data,   then   that   classifier   should   be   able   to   predict   a   sensible   move   given   a   new   feature   vector.Note   that   while   the   good-moves   data   is   what   we   will   test   your   code   with   (or   rather   it   is   one   of the   things   we   will   test   your   code   with),   you   may   want   to   create   some   custom   training   data.    To   make   that   easy,   we   have   provided   TraceAgent   (in   the   file   traceagents.py).    If you   run   this   using:
python3      pacman.py    --p      TraceAgentyou   will   get   the   same   keyboard   controlled   Pacman   as   you   saw   before,   BUT   one   which   outputs   data   on   your   move   and   the   corresponding   feature   vector.    This   data   is   written   to   moves   .txt.    (If   a   file   already   exists   with   that   name,   it   is   over-written,   so   be   careful.)
3.3          Limitations
There   are   some   limitations   on   what   you   can   submit.
(a)   Your   code   should   be   in   Python   3.
Code   written   in   a   language   other   than   that   will   not   be   marked.
Code   written   in   Python   2   is   unlikely   to   run   with   the   clean   copy   of   pacman-cw1   that   we   will   test   it   against.    If   it   doesn’t   run,   you   will   lose   marks.
The   reason   for   this   is   that   we   do   not   have   the   resources   to   deal   with   code   written   in   multiple   languages,   and   to   ensure   that   we   can   run   code   written   in   Python   2.
(b)    Your   code   will   be   tested   in   the   same   environment   as   we   have   been   using   in   the   lab.      That   is   the   standard   Anaconda   Python   3   distribution,   with   scikit-learn   also   installed   (and   the   scikit-learn   distribution   includes   numpy).    Code   using   libraries   that   are   not   in   this   collection may   not   run   when   we   test   it.    If   you   choose   to    use   such   libraries   and   your   code   does   not   run   when   we   test   it,   you   will   lose   marks.The   reason   for   this   is   that   we   do   not   have   the   resources   to   deal   with   setting   up   arbitrarily   complex    environments    (with    the    possibility    of    libraries    with    arcane    interactions)    for   every   submission.
(c)   Your code must only interact with the   Pacman environment by making calls through the version   of   api   .py   supplied   in   pacman-cw1   .zip.      Code   that   finds   other   ways   to   access   information   about   the   environment   will   lose   marks.
The   idea   here   is   to   have   everyone   solve   the   same   task.
(d)   You   are   not   allowed   to   modify   any   of the   files   in   pacman-cw1   .zip   except   classifier.py.Similar   to   the   previous   point,   the   idea   is   that   everyone   solves   the   same   problem   —   you   can’t   change   the   problem   by   modifying   the   base   code   that   runs   the      Pacman   environment.      Also,   your   code   will   have   to   run   against   a   clean   version   of the   code   in   pacman-cw1   so   you’ll just   be   making   trouble   for   yourself.
(e)   You are not allowed to copy, without credit, code that you might get from   other   students   or   find   lying   around on the   Internet.    (This   includes the   use of code   that   was   distributed   as   part   of the   module   —   if   you   use   code   from   files   other   than   classifier.py and   classifierAgent   .py   without   attribution,   we   will   consider   that   to   be   plagiarism.)   We   will   be   checking.This   is   the   usual   plagiarism   statement.   When   you   submit   work   to   be   marked,   you   should   only   seek to   get   credit   for work you   have   done yourself.    When   the   work   you   are   submitting   is   code,   you   can   use   code   that   other   people   wrote,   but   you   have   to   say   clearly   that   the   other   person   wrote   it   —   you   do   that   by   putting   in   a   comment   that   says   who   wrote   it.    That   way   we   can   adjust   your   mark   to   take   account   of   the   work   that   you   didn’t   do.      Please   add   any   citations,   descriptions,   or   whatever   you   want   us   to   know   in   the   python   file.Please   also   ensure   you   familiarise   yourselves   with   what   constitutes    plagiarism   and   collusion   and   how   to   avoid   them   (ensure   you   read   the   information   on   KEATS);   e.g.   copying   large   parts   of   code   from   others,   even   with   attribution,   is   not   allowed.   We   need   to   be   able   to   assess   your   OWN   contribution.
(f)   Your   code   must   be   based   on   using   a   classifier   on   the   data   in   good-moves   .txt.    If you   don’t   submit   a   program   that   contains   a   recognisable   classifier,   you   will   lose   marks.
4          What   you   have   to   hand   in
Your   submission   should   consist   of   a   single   ZIP   file.       (KEATS   will   be   configured   to   only   accept   a   single   file.)   This   ZIP   file   must   include   a   single   Python   file   (your   code):    classifier.py.
The   ZIP   file   must   be   named:
cw1--   .zip
Remember   that   we   are   going   to   evaluate   your   code   by   running   your   code   by   using   variations   on   python3      pacman.py      -p      ClassifierAgent
and we will   do this   in   a vanilla   copy   of the   pacman-cw1   folder,   so   the   base   class   for   your   agent   must   be   called   ClassifierAgent   and   use   class   Classifier   and   the   skeleton   provided.
To   streamline   the   marking   of   the   coursework,   you   must   put   all   your   code   in   one   file,   and   this   file   must   be   called   classifier.py   (which we   provide).
Do   not just   include the whole pacman-cw1 folder.    You   should   only   include the   one   file that   includes   the   code   you   have   written.    Do   not   modify   any   of the   other   files   either   when   developing   your   code.
Submissions   that   do   not   follow   these   instructions   will   lose   marks.
5          How   your   work   will   be   marked
There   will   be   three   main   components   of the   mark   for   your   work:
(a)      Functionality
We will test your code   in   classifier.py   by   running the   classifierAgents   .py file   against   a   clean   copy   of pacman-cw1.
As   discussed   above,   for   full    marks   for   functionality,    your   code    is    required    to    run    when   we   invoke   the   command:
python3      pacman.py      --p      ClassifierAgent
and   run   until   the   game   is   won   or   lost.      Code   that   fails   to   meet   these   requirements   will   lose   marks.We   will   also   look   at   your   code   for   evidence   of   the   use   of   a   classifier.    Code   that   does   not   use   a   classifier   will   lose   marks.    Code   that   does   not   implement   a   classifier   (that   is,   uses   one   from   an   external   library   like   scikit-learn)   will   lose   marks.Code   that    implements    more   sophisticated   classifiers   will   get    more    marks.       So,    my      example   (above)   of   using   a   1-NN   classifier,   which   is   about   the   simplest   possible   classifier,   would   not   get   as   many   marks   as   the   implementation   of   a   more   sophisticated   classifier.
(b)    Style.	There   are   no   particular   requirements   on   the   way   that   your   code   is   structured   but   you   should   ensure   it   follows   standard   good   practice   in   software   development   and   will   be   marked   accord-   ingly.Remember   that   your   code   is   only   allowed   to   interact   with   the   Pacman   environment   through   api   .py   (the   version   in   pacman-cw1),   and   is   only   allowed   to   use   the   environment   information   provided   to   the   Classifier   class.   Code   that   does   not   follow   this   rule   will   lose   marks.
(c)    DocumentationAll   good   code   is well   documented,   and your work will   be   partly   assessed   by   the   comments   you   provide   in   your   code.    If we   cannot   understand   from   the   comments   what   your   code   does,   then   you   will   lose   marks.
A   copy   of the   marksheet,   which   shows   the   distribution   of   marks   across   the   different   elements   of the   coursework,   is   available   from   KEATS,   together   with   FAQs.
